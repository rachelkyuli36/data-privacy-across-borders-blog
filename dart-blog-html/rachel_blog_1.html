                    South Koreans generally view government data collection and CCTV surveillance as a protective measure for all citizens 
                    and less as an invasion of their privacy. According to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/651509/south-korea-cctv-cameras/">Statista</a>, 
                    as of 2022, there were over 1.6 million cameras in 
                    operation: they were installed for facility safety and fire detection, traffic law enforcement, and are largely used 
                    to help solve serious criminal cases. And these cameras are rapidly being converted to intelligent CCTVs that would 
                    be used to efficiently and effectively identify concerns as they are happening.<br><br>

                    <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://m.ktv.go.kr/program/again/view?content_id%3D677229&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1698528750818955&usg=AOvVaw1Xh0cIepUoVaYeyYbyXe3v">In one successful use case of intelligent CCTVs</a>
                    : the CCTV system sensed the motion of a man stumbling down an alleyway 
                    at dawn. So, the system put that scene on the screen for the controllers to see. The controllers then saw the man get 
                    into and start driving a vehicle, suspected him of drunk driving, and immediately notified the police. The police were 
                    then able to arrest the man only 4km away from the starting point. Such successful incident detection cases support 
                    the popular sentiment that these surveillance systems are actually helpful in protecting society.<br><br>

                    Broader use cases of intelligent CCTVs include COVID-19 patient tracking in 2020. Systems used 
                    <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/skorea-test-ai-powered-facial-recognition-track-covid-19-cases-2021-12-13/#:~:text=SEOUL%2C%20Dec%2013%20(Reuters),about%20the%20invasion%20of%20privacy.">facial recognition technology</a>
                     to more efficiently trace an infected person’s movements, cutting down on hours of manual patient tracing 
                    by overworked tracing teams. In part due to the great data collection system and deployment of proper policies, South 
                    Korea quickly emerged as a leader in the fight against COVID-19. With these clear benefits to society, the South Korean 
                    people would trust these intelligent systems as they are being more widely implemented.<br><br>

                    This generally positive sentiment, however, does not mean the people are ignoring the potential personal privacy 
                    violations. The implementation of such systems are likely receiving less backlash than we would expect to see in the 
                    United States for example because the South Korean government has already built up trust with the South Korean citizens.<br><br>

                    <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://carnegieendowment.org/2021/08/17/introduction-how-korea-can-unleash-power-of-data-pub-85162&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1698530995248917&usg=AOvVaw2TItFeCvt62cE4f9ooe8yk">According to the Pew Research Center</a>
                    , by 2018 Korea’s internet access reached 96% of adults and the country also has 
                    the world’s highest 4G telecommunications available. Since South Korea is so highly interconnected, there have been 
                    many cases of privacy violations and fraud happening online. But South Korea has been and is still working to build 
                    out strong digital policies and regulations.<br><br>

                    An important aspect of digital regualtion is better authentiction to prevent phishing, fraud, hacking, etc. And 
                    through a <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://carnegieendowment.org/2021/08/17/introduction-how-korea-can-unleash-power-of-data-pub-85162&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1698530995248917&usg=AOvVaw2TItFeCvt62cE4f9ooe8yk">trial and error approach to their policies of authentification</a>
                    , the South Korean government was able to find something that the people would be comfortable with. They first tried using the Resident Registration Number 
                    (equivalent to a Social Security Number) as a form of identification for various transactions, but found that too 
                    much sensitive information was being disclosed in unnecessary situations. They also tried implementing I-PIN Korea, 
                    but it could only be implemented on a specific software, making it inaccessible to many. Finally, in 2012 the 
                    government authorized three mobile network operators and in 2017 seven major credit card companies as identity-verification 
                    agencies. Now, most online systems need verification with a phone number that is registered with a proper Resident 
                    Registration Number, making it difficult for those who are not legally acting in South Korea to access online services. 
                    People already trust their phone providers and banks with their personal information, so the government was able to 
                    capitalize on this trust and actually enforce proper authentication.<br><br>

                    Instead of implementing a whole new system to authenticate online, the government was able to utilize existing 
                    infrastructure, collaborate with trusted entities, and add a layer of security to the system to ensure data security. 
                    By approaching digital security in this way, the South Korean government was able to set a foundation for their future 
                    digitization efforts (like implementing intelligent CCTVs and mass data collection and analysis) to receive minimal backlash.
